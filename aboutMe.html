<h2 align = "center">About Me</h2>

<p align = "center">
I was born and raised in the Conroe/ Woodlands area of Texas, and I lived there until I moved to College Station<br/> 
to start at Texas A&M in August 2016. I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my Aerospace Engineering<br/>
Degree after I graduated, but I was ready to soak up as much knowledge as I could to help guide my decision. Now<br/> 
that I have completed the Texas A&M first-year engineering program and received some mentoring from my professors,<br/> 
I am convinced that Computer Science will never lose my interest.</p>

<p align = "center">
Texas A&M has been an excellent fit for me. I enjoy playing the trumpet with the Wind Symphony here at Texas A&M, as<br/> 
it has given me an avenue to both express my appreciation for music and make new friends with others who share that<br/> 
appreciation. I have also made many friends in other disciplines through the University Honors program that I may not<br/> 
have meet otherwise. I have found that being a part of the University Honors Program has not only enriched my education<br/>
in many ways, but also opened many doors to new academic and professional opportunities.</p>

<p align = "center">
I am striving to complete the Texas A&M Undergraduate Outcomes as I set out to fulfill the requirements of my degree.<br/>
As I approach the final class of my Mathematics Minor and begin the first class of my new Embedded Systems Integration<br/>
Minor, I am also working hard to complete the goals set out by the University Honors Program. I look forward to<br/> 
completing my senior capstone project that I will hopefully complete through the Undergraduate Research Scolars Program<br/>
before I graduate in May 2020.</p>

<p align = "center">
In the future, I hope to gain new insight into the culture of tech and software companies through my internship with<br/>
Lockheed Martin this summer. I am interested in witnessing how teams of software developers work together with their<br/> 
teammates and hardware developers to design products for customers. Some day, I would like to design my own software<br/> 
for a software development company or become a software systems developer. In such a broad and growing field, I couldn't<br/> 
be more excited about what the future holds!</p>
