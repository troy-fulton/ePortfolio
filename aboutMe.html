<h2 align = "center">About Me</h2>

<p align = "center">
I was born and raised in the Conroe/ Woodlands area of Texas where I lived until I moved to College Station to start at<br/>
Texas A&M University in August 2016. I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my Aerospace Engineering<br/>
Degree after I graduated, but I was ready to soak up as much knowledge as I could to help guide my decision. Now<br/>
that I have finished a year in the Computer Science Department, I am convinced that I was meant to be a developer.</p>

<p align = "center">
Texas A&M University has been an excellent fit for me. I enjoy playing the trumpet with the Wind Symphony on campus, as it<br/>
has given me an avenue to both express my appreciation for music and make new friends with others who share<br/>
that appreciation. I have also made many friends in other disciplines through the University Honors program that I may not<br/>
have meet otherwise. The University Honors Program has not only enriched my education<br/>
in many ways, but also opened many doors to new academic and professional opportunities.</p>

<p align = "center">
I am striving to complete the Texas A&M Undergraduate Outcomes as I set out to fulfill the requirements of my degree.<br/>
As I approach the final class of my Mathematics Minor and begin the first class of my new Embedded Systems Integration<br/>
Minor, I am also working hard to complete the goals set out by the University Honors and Engineering Honors Program. I<br/>
look forward to completing my senior capstone project that I will hopefully complete through the Undergraduate Research<br/>
Scolars Program before I graduate in May 2020.</p>

<p align = "center">
I am constantly looking for ways to take what I have learned about development from my various learning experiences and apply<br/>
them to real-world problems. I have learned a great deal about software development methods in my Programming Studio course (Fall<br/>
2018), such as test-driven development and SCRUM, and I am actively seeking opportunities to practice new methodologies alongside<br/>
other professionals as soon as summer 2019. Now that I have finished my internship with Lockheed Martin, I believe that I have<br/>
dramatically improved my technical maturity and competence as well as my business maturity. I believe the next step in my education<br/>
is to perform research alongisde a professor so that I can have a much deeper understanding of my field and contribute to the<br/>
field more than the average person.</p>
