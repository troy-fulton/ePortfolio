<h2 align = "center">About Me</h2>

<p class = "indent" align = "center">
I was born and raised in the Conroe/ Woodlands area of Texas, and I lived there until I moved to College Station<br/> 
to start college in August 2016. I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my Aerospace Engineering Degree<br/> 
after I graduated, but I was ready to soak up as much knowledge as I could to help guide my decision making. Now<br/> 
that I have completed the Texas A&M first-year engineering program and received some mentoring from my professors,<br/> 
I am convinced that Computer Science will never lose my interest.</p>

<p align = "center">
Texas A&M has been an excellent fit for me. I enjoy playing the trumpet with the Wind Symphony here at Texas A&M, as<br/> 
it has given me an avenue to both express my appreciation for music and make new friends with others who share that<br/> 
appreciation. I have also made many friends in other disciplines through the University Honors program that I may not<br/> 
have meet had I pursued the Engineering Honors Program. I have found that being a part of the University Honors<br/> 
Program has not only enriched my education in many ways, but also opened many doors to new academic and professional<br/> 
opportunities.</p>

<p align = "center">
I am striving to complete the Texas A&M Undergraduate Outcomes as I set out to fulfill the requirements of my degree.<br/>
As I approach the final class of my Mathematics Minor, I am also working hard to complete the goals set out by the<br/> 
University Honors Program. I look forward to completing my capstone project as a senior before I graduate.</p>

<p align = "center">
In the future, I hope to gain new insight into the culture of tech and software companies. I am interested in witnessing<br/> 
how teams of software developers work together with their teammates and hardware developers to design products for<br/>
customers. Some day, I would like to design my own software for a software development company or become a software systems<br/> 
developer. In such a broad, growing field, I couldn't be more excited about what the future holds!</p>
