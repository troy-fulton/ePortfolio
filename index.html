Howdy! My name is Troy Fulton, and I am a Computer Science Major from The Woodlands, Texas (but<br/>
more importantly, I am the loudest proudest member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2020 A-A-A-A-A!).</p>

<p align = "center">
Now that my sophomore year is coming to a close, I will continue along into a crutial year<br/> 
of my academic career this fall (2018). As I face a lot of big decisions with regards to what<br/> 
I want to accomplish after I graduate, my goal is now to enrich my education by pursuing <br/>
opportunities to gain a broader and deeper understanding of various topics in Computer Science.<br/>
There are so many ways I can make a difference in the world, and my hope for my junior year is<br/>
that I can identify ways my talents can be used in the work force for the betterment of humankind.</p>

<p align = "center">
I have many new opportunities to explore these talents in the near future! This summer, I will be<br/>
interning with Lockheed Martin Enterprise Operations in Fort Worth, Texas. I will be working on<br/>
software engineering in the business services, and I can't wait to get started!</p>

<p align = "center">
I wrote the HTML and CSS for this website myself, so I apologize for any glitches.<br/>
Please feel free to contact me with questions and/or suggestions.
