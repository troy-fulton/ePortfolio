                I'm finally a rising senior! I've got a lot to look forward to as I begin looking for full time jobs<br/>
                starting in May 2020, but I designed this site as a way to also look back on what I've accomplished <br/>
                in the last three years. When I moved into McFadden Hall in August 2016, I thought I would surely be<br/>
                one of the brightest
            </p>
    
    
            <p>
                Now that my sophomore year is coming to a close, I will continue along into a crutial year<br />
                of my academic career this fall (2018). As I face a lot of big decisions with regards to what<br />
                I want to accomplish after I graduate, my goal is now to enrich my education by pursuing <br />
                opportunities to gain a broader and deeper understanding of various topics in Computer Science.<br />
                There are so many ways I can make a difference in the world, and my hope for my junior year is<br />
                that I can identify ways my talents can be used in the work force for the betterment of humankind.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I have many new opportunities to explore these talents in the near future! This summer, I will be<br />
                interning with Lockheed Martin Enterprise Operations in Fort Worth, Texas. I will be working on<br />
                software engineering in the business services, and I can't wait to get started!
            </p>
