    <h3>SpaceCRAFT</h3>
    <p class = "indent">I participated in Aggie Challenge, a research opportunity available to students at Texas A&M <br/>
        University as a class guided by graduate students and professors. I was a part of SpaceCRAFT, an interactive,<br/>
        web-based Virtual Reality Platform. SpaceCRAFT's purpose was to allow users from across the globe participate<br/>
        in projects collaboratively in order to test expensive, complicated projects in virtual reality simulations in<br/>
        order to make real-life decisions. Under the direction of astronaut and professor Dr. Greggory Chamitoff, we<br/>
        presented our findings to NASA at the end of the semester. I presented my research on how heightmaps from USGS's<br/>
        Astropedia can help SpaceCRAFT create fully functioning, to-scale models of our Solar System to NASA representatives.<br/>
        Our team also presented our simulations at the 2017 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase
