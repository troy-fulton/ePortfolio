                            <u>January 2019:</u> At TAMUHack, my team Bumblebee placed "runner-up" in the SmartCar Competition.
                            We used SmartCar's API to build an Android Application to find and unlock your car using Google Maps
                            API. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/LBess/Bumblebee">here</a>.

                            <u>Spring 2018:</u> My friends and I placed 19th in an annual Coding Competition held at our 
                            school among over 100 teams.
                        </li>

                            <u>Spring 2017:</u> In a class-wide (200+ students) competition to see who could write the most
                            efficient code to solve engineering problems in MATLAB, I placed first. This was my first indication
                            that maybe I could be good at programming and a big motivation for my switch to Computer Science
                            as a freshman.
