        <div>
            <p>As I have learned about Computer Science for the past two years, I have picked up several
                skills that I hope
                will aid me when I begin work in the field.</p>

            <h3>Programming Languages:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><b>C++</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learned first for Inro to Program Design Class (first semester of Computer Science)</li>
                        <li>Used in Intro Class to create projects, such as a GUI, and for all programming assignments</li>
                        <li>Also used in Data Structures class for profiling and Analyzing different implementations</li>
                        <li>Used for the Coding Competition from February 2018.</li>
                        <li>Used in juction with FLTK for graphics in GUIs in Intro Class</li>
                        <li>Used gcc in Linux through PuTTY as well as through Windows, both on the command line and
                            through Visual Studios 2017</li>
                        <li>When I was working on the Aggie Challenge Project in UNREAL Engine, I used a small amount
                            of C++.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>C</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learned the basics so as to use it for assignments in Computer Organization Class</li>
                        <li>Used to translate to x86-64 and analyze assembly generated by gcc</li>
                        <li>Used to analyze the speeds of different techniques (such as bitmasking vs jump tables)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>Haskell</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used for Programming Languages Class as example of Functional Language</li>
                        <li>Used to create an interpreter for my own "W Language," as well as a parser</li>
                        <li><a href="../codes/W-Parser-Project.zip" download>Here</a> is the file containing the
                            project assignment
                            and the associated Haskell code.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>Java</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I first learned Java over the summer 2017 for fun. I wanted to create a program that made
                            it easier to write my resume,
                            which I will post on here when I have a prototype (still a work in progress).</li>
                        <li>Used in Programming Languages Class as an example of an object-oriented language</li>
                        <li>Used to program generically for object-oriented programs and program concurrent threading</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>x68-64 and Y86</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As mentioned above (under C), I used C programs to analyze how the gcc C compiler compiles
                            C code into assembly by
                            learning to translate C code to x86-64.</li>
                        <li>Y86 is a reduced (more RISC-like) version of x86-64. I am using it for my final project,
                            where I will be designing
                            and programming a small CPU.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                </li><b>Python</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since ENGR 102 (the new first class of the Freshman Engineering Program) will teach Python, I
                        will be learning Python
                        so that I can effectively teach students as a Peer Teacher starting Fall 2018.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>MATLAB</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My first programming language learned as part of the Freshman Engineering Program (Fall
                            2017)</li>
                        <li>During my second semester (ENGR 112), I learned the language thoroughly, as I used it to
                            code a robot (Lego EV3),
                            design a GUI, and produce object-oriented programs.</li>
                        <li>In ENGR 112, I won a class-wide competition (mentioned in <a href="honorsAndAwards.html">Honors
                                and Awards</a>)
                            to see who could design the fastest program to solve challenging engineering problems on
                            Cody Coursework.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>LabVIEW</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also learned this as part of ENGR 111 in my first semester with MATLAB. Although it is
                            not a traditional language, I used
                            it to code the EV3 robots as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br />
                <li><b>HTML and CSS</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I learned these purely for the purposes of creating this website one weekend, but I found
                            that I really enjoy it and
                            may create even more websites in the future</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                        for their semester project, so I have learned to design a few programs in C++ (<a href="../codes/parkMe.ino"
                            download>example</a>- requires
                        Arduino IDE) so as to help the students learn the language, as well as how to program their

                            Although we did got 19th place out of about 30 teams, we considered it an accomplishment,
                            given that none of us had ever participated in a coding
                            competition before.</li>
