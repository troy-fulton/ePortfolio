        <div>
            <p>I have always loved listening to and playing classical music, especially big orchestral
                symphonies like Pines of Rome and Symphonic Metamorphosis.
                I have been playing trumpet since I was 9 years old, and I still can't put it down. In high school, I
                studied music theory and qualified
                twice in the Texas All-State Philharmonic Orchestra. I participate in the Texas A&M University Wind
                Symphony every semester to get my mind off
                of my most rigorous classes a few times a week, and I have loved getting to know the other
                instrumentalists and making incredible music.</p>

            <p>Last May, the Wind Symphony was granted the priviledge of performing in Hawai'i (pictured
                above). I also participate in the Philharmonic Orchestra
                at Texas A&M offered to Wind Symphony players who want to volunteer. I have enjoyed playing symphonies
                like Nabucco Overture and Berber of Seville
                every semester I have been at Texas A&M. </p>
