                            I have always loved listening to and playing classical music, especially big orchestral
                            symphonies like Pines of Rome and Symphonic Metamorphosis.
                            I have been playing trumpet since I was 9 years old, and I still can't put it down. 
                            In high school, I
                            studied music theory and qualified
                            twice as principle trumpet in the Texas All-State Philharmonic Orchestra. I participate in the 
                            Texas A&M University Wind
                            Symphony every semester to get my mind off
                            of my most rigorous classes a few times a week, and I have loved getting to know the other
                            instrumentalists and making incredible music.

                            I cannot oversell the remarkable program I have been a part of for these four years. As a 
                            college that no longer has a major for music, our school has been granted incredible opportunities 
                            under the leadership of Dr. Timothy Rhea. In May 2017, the Wind Symphony was granted the priviledge 
                            of performing concerts in Hawai'i (pictured above). I also (occasionally) participated in the Philharmonic Orchestra
                            at Texas A&M offered to Wind Symphony volunteers. I have enjoyed playing symphonies
                            like Nabucco Overture and Barber of Seville..

                            In addition to our trip to Hawai'i, the Texas A&M
                            University Wind Symphony was invited to play at the Texas Music Educator's Association Conference
                            in San Antonio in February 2019. We commissioned and performed an exciting new piece by 
                            Donald Grantham, and I got the chance to perform one of my favorite trumpet solos in the second 
                            movement of Persichetti's Symphony for Band, Movement 2. That concert was one of my proudest moments
                            as a trumpet player since many of my past music educators got to see me perform in a hall that I'd
                            had many great experiences in before. I wish I could post a recording of it, but the album is on

                            Starting Fall 2019, we will had the chance to rehearse in a new Music Activities Center with 
                            state of the art technology. We also performed in a clinic on marches at the Midwest Clinic and 
                            Convention held in Chicago December 2019. To keep up with all the newest developments with

                            In my last concert with the Wind Symphony, we were given the privelege of honoring the 
                            late Dr. David Maslanka, whom my friends and I got to meet when we were freshmen, with his
                            last symphony- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mlwJpVoP4g">Symphony No. 10</a>.
                            Unfortunately, my last concert was cancelled because of the COVID-19 epidemic (We were

                            Although it was disappointing to miss out on the last concert, I feel that getting to play 
                            Maslanka's music one more time made for

                            Believe it or not, I once wanted to study music professionally, so I wrote some music in
                            my free time. <a href="https://musescore.com/user/4381981">Here</a> are just some pieces I wrote 
                            over the summer after taking a music theory class that, although cheesy, have somehow gotten me 
                            lots of views on Musescore. Someday, I plan to use
                            my music talents with technology, such as an IoT project. Music is often inspired by what our 
                            senses detect in our surroundings, so I want to see how much a machine learning algorithm could
                            train on given the world around it.
