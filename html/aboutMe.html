        <p>
            I was born and raised in the Conroe/ Woodlands area of Texas, and I lived there until I moved to College
            Station<br />
            to start at Texas A&M in August 2016. I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my Aerospace
            Engineering<br />
            Degree after I graduated, but I was ready to soak up as much knowledge as I could to help guide my
            decision. Now<br />
            that I have completed the Texas A&M first-year engineering program and received some mentoring from my
            professors,<br />
            I am convinced that Computer Science will never lose my interest.</p>

        <p>
            Texas A&M has been an excellent fit for me. I enjoy playing the trumpet with the Wind Symphony here at
            Texas A&M, as<br />
            it has given me an avenue to both express my appreciation for music and make new friends with others who
            share that<br />
            appreciation. I have also made many friends in other disciplines through the University Honors program that
            I may not<br />
            have meet otherwise. I have found that being a part of the University Honors Program has not only enriched
            my education<br />
            in many ways, but also opened many doors to new academic and professional opportunities.</p>


        <p>
            I am striving to complete the Texas A&M Undergraduate Outcomes as I set out to fulfill the requirements of
            my degree.<br />
            As I approach the final class of my Mathematics Minor and begin the first class of my new Embedded Systems
            Integration<br />
            Minor, I am also working hard to complete the goals set out by the University Honors Program. I look
            forward to<br />
            completing my senior capstone project that I will hopefully complete through the Undergraduate Research
            Scolars Program<br />
            before I graduate in May 2020.</p>

        <p>
            In the future, I hope to gain new insight into the culture of tech and software companies through my
            internship with<br />
            Lockheed Martin this summer. I am interested in witnessing how teams of software developers work together
            with their<br />
            teammates and hardware developers to design products for customers. Some day, I would like to design my own
            software<br />
            for a software development company or become a software systems developer. In such a broad and growing
            field, I couldn't<br />
            be more excited about what the future holds!</p>

        <p>
            I'm finally a rising senior! I've got a lot to look forward to as I begin looking for full time jobs<br/>
            starting in May 2020, but I designed this site as a way to also look back on what I've accomplished <br/>
            in the last three years. When I moved into McFadden Hall in August 2016, I thought I would surely be<br/>
            one of the brightest
        </p>


        <p>
            Now that my sophomore year is coming to a close, I will continue along into a crutial year<br />
            of my academic career this fall (2018). As I face a lot of big decisions with regards to what<br />
            I want to accomplish after I graduate, my goal is now to enrich my education by pursuing <br />
            opportunities to gain a broader and deeper understanding of various topics in Computer Science.<br />
            There are so many ways I can make a difference in the world, and my hope for my junior year is<br />
            that I can identify ways my talents can be used in the work force for the betterment of humankind.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have many new opportunities to explore these talents in the near future! This summer, I will be<br />
            interning with Lockheed Martin Enterprise Operations in Fort Worth, Texas. I will be working on<br />
            software engineering in the business services, and I can't wait to get started!
        </p>
