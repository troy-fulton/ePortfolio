                            gain not only the skills to enable such technology but also the knowledge of how the rest of
                            the world can benefit from computational power. I have a long history of sticking my fingers
                            in pies, and now that I am armed with an Aggie engineering degree, I seek 
                            every opportunity to develop new skills so that some day, I can positively and
                            professionally contribute to the world around me.

                            <font size="+1">
                                I was born and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, where I lived in an Aggie family until I 
                                moved to College Station to start my Engineering Bachelors Degree at Texas A&M University in 
                                August 2016. I love traveling, solving puzzles, and exploring the great outdoors. Although I
                                am constantly developing new hobbies, I still like to continue the old ones. Two of my favorite
                                passtimes are playing the trumpet and taking hikes in adventurous places.

                                Every day is the perfect day to learn something new. 
                                I have noticed that when we computer 
                                scientists are faced with a difficult problem, we often solve it by first seeking out 
                                ways to map those difficult
                                problems to problems we know how to solve. That's why I have made it my
                                mission to solve- not just as many problems as I can- but as many <i>types</i> of 
                                problems as I can, even if it means failing the first (few... hundred) tries.

                                One of the most valuable facets of my Aggie education was the access to endless opportunities 
                                to solve any kind of problem I'm willing to put my mind to. For example, 
                                <a href="coursework.html">classes</a> outside my field of study, such as Atmospheric
                                Science, Anthropology, and Probability, gave me the chance to learn what kind of 
                                problems meterologists, paleoanthropologists, and even other engineers solve and how they
                                could benefit from computational power. <a href="activities.html">Honors Programs</a>
                                and experiences like <a href="otherWork.html">my Peer Teaching Job</a> allowed me to 
                                meet distinguished students across the University and learn more about how they view
                                the world.

                                Of course, solving difficult problems often comes with round after round of what Edison 
                                experienced in his first 10,000 light bulb designs. As a consequence of constantly putting 
                                myself in situations outside my comfort zone, I expose weaknesses that help me to 
                                improve. I am not a perfect programmer- or human
                                being for that matter! Even after playing my instrument for over 11 years, I still walk 
                                off the stage of
                                every concert thinking of ways I could make myself a better trumpet player. That's why I 
                                do things like spending a weekend developing a novel software tool at TAMUHack and helping pitch 
                                my team's project as a product to judges. I can always be faster or better
                                at problem-solving, but as you'll see throughout this portfolio, I strive just as much to learn 
                                soft skills.

                                I have a long history of changing my mind. As I started high school, I thought I wanted to fuse 
                                my artistic and mathematical talents and become an architect. Then, after I place in the top 
                                10 trumpet players in the state of Texas, I was sure I wanted to study music  
                                performance. Once I began my college searches, I realized I wanted to pursue something a little 
                                more right-brained and began applying to study engineering at schools across the country. 
                                For much of my first year at Texas A&M University, I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do 
                                with my Aerospace Engineering Degree after I graduated, but I came in ready to soak up as much 
                                knowledge as I could to guide my decision. Once I started to see how much I love problem-solving
                                using programming, I found that my passions resided in computer technology.

                                From then on, I strived more to explore my interests with an open mind, and I'm so glad I did. 
                                Ever since I fell in love with programming, I have approached everything with an open mind. For 
                                example, although I didn't think I would like studying computer architecture, my computer 
                                organization class motivated me to study computer architecture both as a research project and as 
                                a minor in embedded systems. Thus, I found that I have a passion for embedded technology and applied
                                to work with Texas Instruments, a world leader in embedded processing. The more I study 
                                computer science, the more I realize I don't know about the world and how much better I learn 
                                when I admit that I don't and can't know everything.

                                I've made so many friends and memories at Texas A&M. I met so many astounding students in a 
                                myriad of disciplines through the University Honors Program- especially as a freshman living 
                                on campus. Throughout my years at Texas A&M, I got the chance to perform all over the world with
                                the <a href="music.html">Texas A&M University Wind Symphony</a>. As a freshman, I got to participate
