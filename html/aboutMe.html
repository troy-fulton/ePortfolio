                            gain not only the skills to enable such technology but also the knowledge of how the rest of

                            every opportunity to develop new skills so that some day, I can positively and
                            professionally contribute to the world around me.

                                I was born and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, where I lived in an Aggie family until I 
                                moved to College Station to start my Engineering Bachelors Degree at Texas A&M University in 
                                August 2016. I love traveling, solving puzzles, and exploring the great outdoors. Although I
                                am constantly developing new hobbies, I still like to continue the old ones. Two of my favorite
                                passtimes are playing the trumpet and taking hikes in adventurous places.

                                Every day, technology becomes more integrated with our everyday life ("smart" technology 
                                in cars, cell phones, 
                                factories,... you name it!).
                                I see endless opportunities in the 
                                future for processing power and the rising need for 
                                software to help solve the universe's most difficult problems. 
                                As a blossoming engineer with aspirations
                                to become a leading embedded software architect,
                                I am always seeking ways
                                to both deepen my understanding of modern computer science research and broaden my
                                understanding of where, exactly, computers fit in this world of endless opportunity.

                                I have noticed that when we computer 
                                scientists are faced with a difficult problem, we often solve it by first seeking out 
                                ways to map those difficult
                                problems to problems we know how to solve. That's why I have made it my
                                mission to solve- not just as many problems as I can- but as many <i>types</i> of 
                                problems as I can, even if it means failing the first (few... hundred) tries.

                                One of the most valuable facets of my Aggie education the access to endless opportunities 
                                to solve any kind of problem I'm willing to put my mind to. For example, 
                                <a href="coursework.html">classes</a> outside my field of study, such as Atmospheric
                                Science, Anthropology, and Probability, give me the chance to learn what kind of 
                                problems meterologists, paleoanthropologists, and even other engineers solve and how they
                                could benefit from computational power. <a href="activities.html">Honors Programs</a>
                                and experiences like <a href="otherWork.html">my Peer Teaching Job</a> allow me to 
                                meet distinguished students across the University and learn more about how they view
                                the world.

                                Of course, solving difficult problems often comes with round after round of what Edison 
                                experienced in his first 10,000 light bulb designs. As a consequence of constantly putting 
                                myself in situations outside my comfort zone, I have exposed weaknesses I wish to 
                                improve. I am in no way a perfect programmer- or human
                                being for that matter! Even after playing my instrument for over 11 years, I still walk 
                                off the stage of
                                every concert thinking of ways I could make myself a better trumpet player. That's why I 
                                do things like spend a weekend developing a novel software tool at TAMUHack and help pitch 
                                my team's project as a product to judges in an elevator pitch. I can always be faster or better
                                at problem-solving, but as you'll see throughout this portfolio, I strive to learn soft skills
                                just as much.

                                I have a long history of changing my mind. As I started high school, I thought I wanted to fuse 
                                my artistic and mathematical talents and become an architect. Then, after I place in the top 
                                10 trumpet players in the state of Texas, I was sure I wanted to study music  
                                performance. Once I began my college searches, I realized I wanted to pursue something a little 
                                more right-brained and began applying to study engineering at schools across the country. 
                                For much of my first year at Texas A&M University, I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do 
                                with my Aerospace Engineering Degree after I graduated, but I came in ready to soak up as much 
                                knowledge as I could to guide my decision. Once I started to see how much I love problem-solving
                                using programming, I found that my passions resided in computer technology.

                                From then on, I strived more to explore my interests with an open mind, and I'm so glad I did. 
                                Ever since I fell in love with programming, I have approached everything with an open mind. For 
                                example, although I didn't think I would like studying computer architecture, my computer 
                                organization class motivated me to study computer architecture both as a research project and as 
                                a minor in embedded systems. Thus, I found that I have a passion for embedded technology and applied
                                to work with Texas Instruments, a world leader in embedded processing. The more I study 
                                computer science, the more I realize I don't know about the world and how much better I learn 
                                when I admit that I don't and can't know everything.

                                Texas A&M University has been an excellent fit for me. For the past three years, I have enjoyed the 
                                benefits of the University Honors program, especially as a freshman. I was able to quickly 
                                make friends with a community of scholars across a myriad of disciplines whom I may not have gotten
                                the chance to learn from otherwise. I enjoy playing trumpet with the Wind Symphony here, as it has 
                                given me an avenue to express my appreciation for music, balance the hemispheres of my brain, and make 
                                new friends with others who share my passion for making music. Texas A&M University is a place where

                                In August, I will be heading to Peru to study Engineering Ethics, and beginning Fall 2019,
                                I will be preparing my thesis in On-Chip networks, which will be published in April 2020- the
                                month before I graduate! I have completed much of my computer 
                                science education, so now, I am focusing on applying what I have learned to the DSP product line 
                                at TI. I am hopeful that I will get a return offer and continue writing software to improve 
                                TI's line of products and contribute to their global footprint.
