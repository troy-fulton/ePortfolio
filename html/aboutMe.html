                                I was born and raised in The Woodlands, Texas, and I lived there in an Aggie family until I 
                                moved to College Station to start at Texas A&M University in August 2016. I love traveling, solving
                                puzzles, and exploring the great outdoors. I have been playing trumpet since I was 10 and love
                                music so much I almost decided to perform professionally after high school. I enjoy spending time
                                with friends and am constantly searching for ways to challenge myself.

                                Ever since I fell in love with programming during my freshman year, I have learned to approach
                                everything with an open mind. The more I study computer science, the more I realize I don't know 
                                about the world and how much better I learn when I admit that I don't and can't know everything.
                                I was not entirely sure what I wanted to do with my Aerospace Engineering Degree after I graduated, 
                                but I was ready to soak up as much knowledge as I could to help guide my decision. I spent my first 
                                year exploring my interest with an open mind and found that my passion resides in computers, and
                                I'm so glad I did.

                                Texas A&M University has been an excellent fit for me. When I first started here,
                                I lived on campus in McFadden Hall as part of the University Honors Program. I quickly 
                                made friends with a community of scholars across a myriad of disciplines whom I may not have gotten
                                the chance to learn from otherwise. Being a part of the University Honors Program has not only 
                                enriched my education in many ways, but also opened many doors to new academic and professional opportunities. 
                                I enjoy playing trumpet with the Wind Symphony here, as it has given me an avenue to express my 
                                appreciation for music, balance the hemispheres of my brain, and make new friends with others who 
                                share my passion for making music. Texas A&M University is a place where curiosity thrives. I am lucky
                                that as long as I remain passionate about learning as much as I can, fellow Aggies will always support
                                my educational efforts.

                                I will be preparing my thesis in interconnection networks. I have completed much of my computer 
                                science education, so now, I am focusing on applying what I have learned to the DSP processors at TI.
                                I am hopeful that I will get a return offer and continue writing software to improve TI's line of 
                                products and contribute to their global footprint.
