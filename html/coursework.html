        <div>
            <p>Below I have listed the courses I have taken at Texas A&M so far. I have gone into detail
                about my experiences
                in classes from which I have learned a lot about the world. There are some classes, like Anthropology,
                that I was cautious to take
                because they made me uncomfortable, but I have learned that it is from those classes that I grow the
                most. Hopefully, in the future,
                I will get the chance to take more classes like these and continue to positively change my perspective
                on areas of study inside and
                out of my major.</p>

            <h3>Freshman Year (Fall 2016 and Spring 2017)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Texas A&M First-Year Engineering Program (ENGR 111/112):</u> These classes challenged me to
                    think algorithmically
                    and coordinate with engineers of unfamiliar disciplines in order to assemble robotics projects and
                    presentations
                    throughout the year. I also learned my first coding language, MATLAB, as I worked both on rigorous
                    individual
                    assignments and group coding projects. My professors and peers enculturated me to think like an
                    engineer and thirst
                    for ways to both understand the universe and use my findings to improve lives around the world.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Design Process (ENDS 101):</u> The knowledge I gained from this class, such as how to file a
                    provisionary patent, was
                    invaluable. In this course, I experienced what it is like to work on interdisciplinary projects
                    with people of mindsets
                    completely different from my own. My main takeaway from this course was that I learned to create
                    knowledge rather
                    than reproduce it.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*University Honors Seminar (UGST 181):</u>In these "family meetings," I met weekly with students
                    of many other studies
                    to discuss aspects of our college career such as career goals and our plans for our capstone
                    projects.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Introduction to Anthropology (ANTH 201):</u> This course opened my eyes to brand new ways of
                    thinking about our
                    race that I don't think I would have imagined before. Witnessing the evidence of our evolution and
                    truly trying to pin
                    down a definition for "culture" taught me that it is in human nature to depend on one another for
                    survival. Therefore,
                    we have become experts at communication. The birth and history of the human race and our abilities
                    interests me
                    enough to want to study it more in the future, perhaps with a link to computer science that might
                    show me a way to
                    better develop computer languages that are easier to understand and use.

            <h3>Sophomore Year (Fall 2017 and Spring 2018)</h3>

            <ul>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Introduction to Program Design Concepts (CSCE 121):</u> In this class, I learned the basics of
                    how to organize a program
                    such that it is easier for a reader to understand. I learned the basic syntax of C++ so that I
                    could work on programming
                    assignments on my own and in teams. I leared about Object Oriented Programming, as well as how to
                    use libraries and
                    create header file interfaces. I also learned some of the basics for other classes, like data
                    structures, computer
                    organization, and programming languages, through assignments that required us to construct linked
                    lists and grammars
                    and understand how the CPU interacts with the rest of the computer.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Discrete Structures of Computing (CSCE 222):</u> In this discrete-math-like course, I learned
                    the basic mathematical
                    building blocks used for many things in computer science, such as proving the efficiency of a
                    program. In this class,
                    we dissected topics like time complexity and recursion as well as designing finite state automata
                    and Turing Machines.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Intro to Computing Seminar (CSCE 181)</u>
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Weather and Climate (ATMO 201)</u>
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Principles of Statistics I (STAT 211)</u>
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Computer Organization (CSCE 312):</u> I am learning how all the parts of a CPU work together and
                    how to program them in
                    x86-64 assembly, as well as Y86, a "toy" version I am using for my final project. I learned how to
                    design an ALU and
                    register files using logic gates in Logisim, as well as data path and control elements for
                    designing a CPU. Our labs
                    involve analyzing C code and writing it in assembly code, and I will also soon learn about how to
                    write cache-friendly
                    programs.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Programming Languages (CSCE 314):</u> Through the use of one functional programming language
                    (Haskell) and one object-
                    oriented language (Java), I have learned how to design grammars and data structures in both types
                    of languages. With
                    Haskell, we have written a parser for our own small language, as well as an interpreter. In Java,
                    we have learned how to
                    program generically in an object-oriented language, as well as the basics of Type Theory. We will
                    soon learn the basics
                    for concurrent programming.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>*Data Structures and Algorithms (CSCE 221):</u> In this class, I have learned what is at the
                    heart of computer science. We
                    have learned and practiced the use of abstract data types such as lists, queues, stacks, heaps,
                    binary trees, (2,3) trees,
                    and many more. Through programming in C++, we have implemented different data structures for each
                    of the ADTs to
                    see which ones are the most time and space efficient. I have also learned how to assess programs
                    for efficiency through
                    profiling and time complexity analysis through Visual Studio Projects. We have begun learning how
                    to use data structures
                    to implement different sorting algorithms and will soon learn more useful algorithms.
                </li>
                <li style="margin:10px;">
                    <u>Public Speaking (COMM 203):</u> Speaking extemporaneously in this class has taught me the
                    importance of being able to
                    speak to a large number of people in four specific ways. I can give an introductory speech about
                    myself or someone else; I
                    can speak with a group in a symposium format; I can speak persuasively on topics of policy; I can
                    give a speech of refutation.
                    I learned not only how to present myself to an audience but also how to best prepare for a speech
                    by organizing my thoughts
                    and research beforehand.
            </ul>
