                            Here are the courses I have taken so far and plan to take as a student at Texas A&M 
                            University. I have written about
                            some of the most valuable takeaways from the maroon classes (expand to read more).
                            Each class has uniquely contributed to my depth and breadth of knowledge
                            and expertise I have gained over the past few years.

                                                These classes were my first glimpse at how engineers use their skills to 
                                                collaboratively solve problems both large and small in the world. 
                                                I learned to "think algorithmically" when facing problems 
                                                that I can't solve with traditional methods I learned from mathematics and 
                                                science. 
                                                I learned the value of practicing good teaming strategies from projects where
                                                we designed, built, and programmed Lego EV3 Mindstorm robots in MATLAB and 
                                                LabVIEW to perform tasks like sorting marbles and traversing a table.

                                                Texas A&M University's freshman engineering program is unique- my peers and I 
                                                started school as "General Engineering" students, then applied to our disciplines
                                                once we had finished these classes. This allowed me to investigate my interests 
                                                more easily than if I had been busy with basics classes in my major. During my 
                                                second semester, I had my "falling in love with coding" moment and decided that
                                                the best way for me to make my positive impact on society was to continue 
                                                pursuing the discipline.

                                                The professor I had in my second semester (ENGR 112) particularly challenged me 
                                                by giving the class extra challenge problems to complete as additional homework.
                                                He held a competition throughout the semester to see who could come up with the 
                                                "fastest" solution (measured by varying metrics), and by the end of the semester,
                                                I had come out with the highest number of points.

                                            I gained invaluable knowledge from this class, such as how to file a
                                            provisionary patent and tips on how to come up with new ideas. 
                                            In this class, I was challenged to work on interdisciplinary projects
                                            with people of mindsets completely different from my own. 
                                            My main takeaway from this class was the knowledge of the difference
                                            between creating knowledge and reproducing it. This comes in handy
                                            with my research, as I search for projects that can really contribute 
                                            to the field. I'll also need to understand these concepts in case I 
                                            come up with new ideas as I am working in the industry that I may
                                            want to patent.

                                            of many other studies

                                                This course opened my eyes to brand
                                                new ways of
                                                thinking about the human
                                                race that I don't think I would have imagined before. Witnessing the
                                                evidence of our
                                                evolution and
                                                truly trying to pin
                                                down a definition for "culture" taught me that it is in human nature to
                                                depend on
                                                one another for
                                                survival. Therefore,
                                                we have become experts at communication. The birth and history of the human
                                                race and
                                                our abilities
                                                interests me
                                                enough to want to study it more in the future, perhaps with a link to
                                                computer
                                                science that might
                                                show me a way to
                                                better develop computer languages that are easier to understand and use.
                                                This class has motivated me to learn more about the code of the

                                            Programming, as well as how to
                                            use libraries and
                                            create header file interfaces. I also learned some of the basics for other
                                            classes, like data
                                            structures, computer
                                            organization, and programming languages, through assignments that required
                                            us to construct linked
                                            lists and grammars
                                            and understand how the CPU interacts with the rest of the computer.
                                            I still use much of what I learned about the basic thought processes behind
                                            writing a good program in my classes.

                                                Discrete mathematics forms a foundation for much of the theory behind the study of
                                                program complexity and optimization. This class taught me the basics of how 
                                                to analyze the complexity of a program as a series/summation, how to operate on 
                                                mathematical sets and functions, how to write proofs about recursion and induction,
                                                how to write a proper relation, and how to analyze formal languages. Finally, in the
                                                last part of the course, I learned the theory behind Turing Machines and how to use
                                                finite state automata to solve problems.

                                                because the foundations of our study of computing structures comes from discrete
                                                mathematics. My justification:

                                                University Core Curriculum</a> states that "Courses in this category focus on 
                                                quantitative literacy in logic, patterns, and relationships." In CSCE 222, we 
                                                analyzed mathematical relationships in mathematical relations and functions. We 
                                                learned to recognize patterns in programs when studying program complexity, as we 
                                                need to be able to quickly tell how a program behaves as the size of the program 
                                                gets very large. Finally, we studied logic in the beginning of the course when 
                                                we studied propositional and prepositional logic and how to write inductive proofs.
                                                The Core Curriculum also says that math courses should focus on "critical thinking, 
                                                communication, and empirical and quantitative" skills. In CSCE 222, we focused on
                                                critical thinking in every aspect of the class, as the professor commonly gave us
                                                homework that challenged us to go beyond the basic concepts studied in class, and
                                                exams gave us the challenge of thinking of problems in new ways. We learned 
                                                communication skills via discussions in class about how to solve problems that apply
                                                theory discussed in class. Also, we learned empirical and quantitative skills by
                                                applying our knowledge of program complexity to real programs that we might write
                                                for industry applications. We also went beyond learning just how to write a finite 
                                                state machine to learn how to frame real-world problems using states and 
                                                transitions. We learned that sometimes problems cannot be solved using Turing
                                                Machines, which gave us further insight into how we take a real world problem and 
                                                prove whether it can be solved using the traditional computer model and 
                                                communicate the problem more clearly to others.

                                                This class gave me the motivation to study Computer Architecture as
                                                my project for the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program my
                                                senior year that would also serve as my senior design. It also
                                                motivated my study of Embedded Systems in my minor. Much of 
                                                what I learned in my minor was taught in this class.

                                                I began by learning how most CPU architectures are set up
                                                (the organization of the CPU, main memory, and drivers
                                                along a bus in x86). As much of the course was centered around the 
                                                x86 architecture, I learned how to write assembly programs 
                                                using Y86, a "toy" simulator I use for verifying register
                                                and memory contents before and after execution. We began the 
                                                course learning digital logic basics and built upon black box
                                                diagrams to form adders, shifters, register files, and more.
                                                Our group term project was to develop a small CPU in Logisim, 
                                                write our own small ISA, and write a program to perform matrix
                                                multiplication. I also learned about how set associative and
                                                direct caching works and how to pipeline software and hardware
                                                by adding registers between stages such as IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB.
                                                This was my first experience writing low-level, 
                                                bit-manipulative C code.

                                            of languages. With

                                            we have learned how to

                                            In this class, I have learned what is at the
                                            heart of computer science. We
                                            have learned and practiced the use of abstract data types such as lists,
                                            queues, stacks, heaps,
                                            binary trees, (2,3) trees,
                                            and many more. Through programming in C++, we have implemented different
                                            data structures for each
                                            of the ADTs to
                                            see which ones are the most time and space efficient. I have also learned
                                            how to assess programs
                                            for efficiency through
                                            profiling and time complexity analysis through Visual Studio Projects. We
                                            have begun learning how
                                            to use data structures
                                            to implement different sorting algorithms and will soon learn more useful
                                            algorithms.

                                            Speaking extemporaneously in this class has taught me the
                                            importance of being able to
                                            speak to a large number of people in four specific ways. I can give an
                                            introductory speech about
                                            myself or someone else; I
                                            can speak with a group in a symposium format; I can speak persuasively on
                                            topics of policy; I can
                                            give a speech of refutation.
                                            I learned not only how to present myself to an audience but also how to best
                                            prepare for a speech
                                            by organizing my thoughts
                                            and research beforehand.

                                            Many of the questions I have had since I was a kid about why the sky turns
                                            certain colors or how to read the maps on the weather channel were answered
                                            in this class. I learned how to interpret the forecast to make basic
                                            predictions
                                            about which areas will experience high and low temperature and pressure and
                                            what kind of precipitation to expect (we looked at a storms in and out of
                                            this class). Now I can't help but notice new things about the clouds when I

                                                I learned how to define an operating system and why we need them. This class
                                                taught me the importance of protecting hardware from malicious or unintentionally
                                                buggy code that might try to harm computer systems. I also learned how I can request
                                                resources from the operating systems via system calls and what happens when I run
                                                my code on Linux. I gained a deeper understanding of how not only the compiler
                                                and other programs work but also how the linker and loader work together when
                                                running a program. I also learned how to write concurrent and synchronous programs
                                                that utilize mutliple threads and/or processes by learning what resources they share
                                                and how to command the OS to designate those resources, such as pipelining or
                                                message sending.

                                                This class served as a great way to set up for the rest of my undergraduate
                                                coursework, since I needed to know what resources I could use, for example, for 
                                                network processes in CSCE 463 (Networks and Distributed Processes). I did a
                                                programming assignment meant to emulate a fully functional shell as well as one
                                                meant to use interprocess communication and semaphores.

                                                This class served as my "Junior Capstone," as I took many of the concepts I
                                                learned so far in my basic computer science classes and applied them to new
                                                projects. As the computer science industry grows, each day of work provides a
                                                new challenge to learn something new and apply it to the real world. Since those
                                                kinds of projects demand team cooperation, we need to be prepared to work
                                                in teams to produce software using not only version control software such as
                                                git, but also using modern Agile methodologies for keeping up with team 
                                                development progress. That is why, for each of the last three projects, we
                                                committed to SCRUM meetings and design documents, to emulate the real world.
                                                One example of a document we produced is the interaction diagram below.

                                                This studio class was designed to give me fresh new topics to explore in a 
                                                group: NTP Servers, Database Management Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and
                                                Human-Computer Interaction. I performed the first project on my own using a
                                                Python program that would query several servers and determine which was the 
                                                "outlier" (took the longest to respond without timing out). For the rest of 
                                                the projects, I was put into three different groups, where we implemented a
                                                DBMS parser and interpreter for our own relational database system. Above is
                                                the interaction diagram for the project.

                                                For the third project, we implemented the classic
                                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting">pancake flipping game</a>
                                                using the ncurses library on the department server using a command line
                                                interface, as can be seen above. For the final project, I took this 
                                                implementation with a new team
                                                and made a better version using the same ncurses library. Then, we
                                                developed the same game, using the FLTK graphics library. Finally, we made a 
                                                thrid version ported to NANA graphics in Visual Studio all in the effort to
                                                make the game easier for people to play and understand. 
                                                We surveyed "customers" in each phase of development to see how they liked 
                                                certain parts of the design along the way then presented our findings to the 
                                                class at the end of the semester.

                                                As my first introduction to the classes in this department, I learned quickly that
                                                teamwork is key. Much of what I learned in this class overlapped with what I had
                                                learned in CSCE 312 (Computer Organization) about combinatorial and sequential logic
                                                at the gate level and MSI devices. I learned to solder my own circuit 
                                                board that used IR sensors and LEDs to indicate if my robot hovered over a wire.
                                                I also learned how to design IC's to integrate into machines such as a railroad
                                                crossing light. As a mostly (unofficially) writing-intensive course, I also learned
                                                how to produce a well-documented, clear, and concise lab report. I also learned how
                                                to use professional software, such as Multisim, to program my robot using the 
                                                Xilinx interface.

                                            My first experience programming a microcontroller other than Arduino. in 
                                            this class, I learned to use Code Composer Studio to connect to a microcontroller
                                            and access its internals and components. Since I already knew the C language,
                                            I was mostly learning how to look at a wiring diagram of components to configure
                                            them in my program, such as configuring the direction of ports, as well as enabling
                                            digital to analog conversion and the other way around. I also learned how to navigate
                                            documents such as the user's guide and datasheet to get what I need to know about
                                            a microcontroller, especially those from TI.

                                                In this fascinating class, I developed the skillset to understand and implement many
                                                protocols governing the top four layers of the protocol stack, including
                                                congestion control, flow control, and TCP connections. I implemented a
                                                multithreaded web client, DNS resolver, and reliable data transfer.
                                                For each of these projects, I was challenged to understand not only how networks
                                                are set up, but also why companies may want to implement certain parts themselves,
                                                such as an intranet.

                                                All development for the class was done in Visual Studio, and we heavily used
                                                the Winsock library as well as relevant system calls, such as gethostbyname().
                                                In class, we learned about HTTP, DNS basics and vulnerabilities, and P2P at the
                                                application layer. We learned multiplexing, rdt, fairness, flow control, and 
                                                congestion control at the transport layer. At the network layer, we learned 
                                                different switching and routing algorithms, as well as IP and BGP and 
                                                mulicasting/broadcasting. Finally, at the data-link layer, we learned CSMA,
                                                error detection (Hamming codes), and Ethernet. These lists are not at all

                                                Although I ended up Q-dropping this class, I enjoyed learning about how to
                                                take a binary and discover the hidden meaning behind the assembly. Now that
                                                assembly can easily be acquired from the binary executable file in just about
                                                any operating system, the main struggle in this field is automated reverse
                                                compilation, in which the assembly is interpreted to reassemble to source code.

                                                Although it doesn't count for the minor, this class motivated me to pursue
                                                interdisciplinary cybersecurity using my ESET knowledge, which is the reason I
                                                decided to take the network security class CSCE 465. I learned how to use 
                                                IDA Pro fairly proficiently and participated in the TAMU CTF competition, which
                                                I reported for this class <a href="../docs/CTF.pdf">here</a>.

                                                This class gave me fairly good familiarity with x86 and the format of PE files.
                                                In this class, we also completed modules that taught us how to reverse a binary
                                                file with given format as an exe or dll file.

                                                The only part of the class I did not complete was the final project, through
                                                which I was to research the memory heap implemented in Windows XP and report
                                                how I could recognize patterns in programs that wish to corrupt the heap.
                                                I did research on a few basic attack mechanisms that can be seen

                                            I am now pursuing a Cybersecurity Minor, I can no longer pursue it. The biggest
                                            takeaway from this class is that I learned to look at a situation and somewhat
                                            accurately (given certain assumptions) state the probability of certain events
                                            happening. I also had the benefit of learning about communication classes and

                                                This class also overlapped a lot with my computer organization course (CSCE 312),
                                                but I had the benefit of learning new architectures, such as MIPS and ARM. I 
                                                learned how to program an FPGA board to make electronic components just as easily
                                                (if not more easily) as I created them with digital logic gates. In this class,
                                                I got to read the work of Hennessey and Patterson about computer organization,
                                                whom I did a research project on in CSCE 221.

                                                One major thing I learned in this class was how to get used to a new 
                                                architecture. My quick exposure to MIPS and ARM gave me an idea of what it was
                                                like to start my internship at TI the next summer, where I needed to learn
                                                the architecture of a product that wasn't even in production yet.
