                            Here are the courses I have taken so far and plan to take as a student at Texas A&M 
                            University. I have written about
                            some of the most valuable takeaways from the maroon classes (expand to read more).
                            Each class has uniquely contributed to my depth and breadth of knowledge
                            and expertise I have gained over the past few years.

                                            These classes challenged me to think algorithmically and coordinate with
                                            engineers of unfamiliar disciplines in order to assemble robotics projects
                                            and presentations throughout the year. I also learned my first coding
                                            language,
                                            MATLAB, as I worked both on rigorous individual assignments and group coding
                                            projects. My professors and peers enculturated me to think like an engineer
                                            and
                                            thirst for ways to both understand the universe and use my findings to
                                            improve
                                            lives around the world.

                                            The knowledge I gained from this class, such as
                                            how to file a
                                            provisionary patent, was
                                            invaluable. In this course, I experienced what it is like to work on
                                            interdisciplinary projects
                                            with people of mindsets
                                            completely different from my own. My main takeaway from this course was that
                                            I
                                            learned to create
                                            knowledge rather
                                            than reproduce it.

                                            This course opened my eyes to brand
                                            new ways of
                                            thinking about our
                                            race that I don't think I would have imagined before. Witnessing the
                                            evidence of our
                                            evolution and
                                            truly trying to pin
                                            down a definition for "culture" taught me that it is in human nature to
                                            depend on
                                            one another for
                                            survival. Therefore,
                                            we have become experts at communication. The birth and history of the human
                                            race and
                                            our abilities
                                            interests me
                                            enough to want to study it more in the future, perhaps with a link to
                                            computer
                                            science that might
                                            show me a way to
                                            better develop computer languages that are easier to understand and use.

                                            such that it is easier for a reader to understand. I learned the basic
                                            syntax of C++ so that I
                                            could work on programming
                                            assignments on my own and in teams. I leared about Object Oriented

                                            use libraries and
                                            create header file interfaces. I also learned some of the basics for other

                                            structures, computer

                                            x86-64 assembly, as well as Y86, a "toy" version I am using for my final
                                            project. I learned how to
                                            design an ALU and
                                            register files using logic gates in Logisim, as well as data path and

                                            designing a CPU. Our labs
                                            involve analyzing C code and writing it in assembly code, and I will also
                                            soon learn about how to
                                            write cache-friendly

                                            Through the use of one functional programming language
                                            (Haskell) and one object-
                                            oriented language (Java), I have learned how to design grammars and data
                                            structures in both types
                                            of languages. With
                                            Haskell, we have written a parser for our own small language, as well as an
                                            interpreter. In Java,
                                            we have learned how to
                                            program generically in an object-oriented language, as well as the basics of

                                            soon learn the basics
                                            for concurrent programming.

                                            In this class, I have learned what is at the
                                            heart of computer science. We
                                            have learned and practiced the use of abstract data types such as lists,
                                            queues, stacks, heaps,
                                            binary trees, (2,3) trees,
                                            and many more. Through programming in C++, we have implemented different
                                            data structures for each
                                            of the ADTs to
                                            see which ones are the most time and space efficient. I have also learned
                                            how to assess programs
                                            for efficiency through
                                            profiling and time complexity analysis through Visual Studio Projects. We
                                            have begun learning how
                                            to use data structures
                                            to implement different sorting algorithms and will soon learn more useful
                                            algorithms.

                                            Speaking extemporaneously in this class has taught me the
                                            importance of being able to
                                            speak to a large number of people in four specific ways. I can give an
                                            introductory speech about
                                            myself or someone else; I
                                            can speak with a group in a symposium format; I can speak persuasively on
                                            topics of policy; I can
                                            give a speech of refutation.
                                            I learned not only how to present myself to an audience but also how to best
                                            prepare for a speech
                                            by organizing my thoughts
                                            and research beforehand.

                                            in this class. I learned how to interpret the forecast to make basic

                                            about which areas will experience high and low temperature and pressure and
                                            what kind of precipitation to expect (we looked at a storms in and out of
                                            this class). Now I can't help but notice new things about the clouds when I
