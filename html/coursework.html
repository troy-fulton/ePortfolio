                                                                started school as "General Engineering" students, then applied to our disciplines

                                                                the best way for me to make my positive impact on society was to continue 
                                                                pursuing the discipline.

                                                                by giving the class extra challenge problems to complete as additional homework.
                                                                He held a competition throughout the semester to see who could come up with the 
                                                                "fastest" solution (measured by varying metrics), and by the end of the semester,
                                                                I had come out with the highest number of points.

                                                            I gained invaluable knowledge from this class, such as how to file a
                                                            provisionary patent and tips on how to come up with new ideas. 
                                                            In this class, I was challenged to work on interdisciplinary projects
                                                            with people of mindsets completely different from my own. 
                                                            My main takeaway from this class was the knowledge of the difference
                                                            between creating knowledge and reproducing it.

                                                            This comes in handy
                                                            with my research, as I search for projects that can really contribute 
                                                            to the field. I'll also need to understand these concepts in case I 
                                                            come up with new ideas as I am working in the industry that I may
                                                            want to patent or copyright. I have learned that the computer science
                                                            industry depends heavily on broadly and vaguely worded patents, but
                                                            a copyright on software can go much further when looking at a company's PI.

                                                            much more. I learned the basic

                                                            assignments on my own and in teams. I leared about Object Oriented

                                                                learned in CSCE 312 (Computer Organization) about combinatorial and sequential logic

                                                            they state that one of the eight great ideas in computers has been to make the
                                                            common case fast. Much of computer science hinges on making a probabilistic guess
                                                            at how data in a computer might behave, such as probabilistic data structures
                                                            or predicting network usage.

                                                            Having learned this in some of my basic computer science classes, I thought it would
                                                            benefit me to sit in a class with mostly engineers of other majors and learn
                                                            how to take probabilistic approaches to more general problems so that I could
                                                            more easily apply what I learned to, for example, my research. The biggest
                                                            takeaway from this class is that I learned to look at a situation and somewhat
                                                            accurately (given certain assumptions) state the probability of certain events
                                                            happening. I also had the benefit of learning about communication classes and
                                                            the probabilities associated with their graphs.

                                                                learned how to program an FPGA board to make electronic components just as easily

                                                                the architecture of a product that wasn't even in production yet.
