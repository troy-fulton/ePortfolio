                            I joined my cohort of Engineering Honors in August 2018, meaning that the honors activities
                            I participated in prior to then were a part of <a href="UHonors.html">University Honors</a>.
                            See the University Honors page for more details.

                            As an Engineering Honors student, I am also required to attend two events each semester. These
                            events, however, are usually geared towards either learning more about research in our department
                            or landing a top notch career. For example, I usually attend the EH Course Scheduling Social,
                            where I counsel freshmen and other honors students about how to most successfully plan their 
                            careers.

                            Another event I like to attend is the Spring Banquet. At the spring banquet, awards are given to 
                            students and faculty who have excelled in their work or committment to Aggie education. Since I
                            received a scholarship, I was invited to attend and meet my donor.

                            As mentioned on the University Honors page, one of the major advantages Honors is the ability to 
                            register early for honors courses. I like to register for these classes because I get a better 
                            insight into whatever topic I'm exploring, and with such a small class size, the professor can 
                            more easily focus on the needs of the class and give students more individual attention. Small 
                            class sizes of motivated, excelling students also provides a more collaborative atmosphere of 
                            learning. To learn more about specific honors classes I've taken, see

                            Engineering Honors requires that I choose a professor to perform research under. During my senior
                            year, I studied On-Chip Networks and Memory Networks under Dr. E.J. Kim, my Computer Organization
                            professor (see <a href="research.html">here</a>).

                            For the 2018-2019 academic year, I was honored to be awarded a $1000 scholarship from the 
                            Industrial Affiliates Program. The IAP has provided many benefits to Engineering Honors students,
                            and I am thankful that they considered me among my ACE Scholar peers to be awarded this scholarship.
