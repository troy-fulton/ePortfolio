                            In summer 2018, I worked in Grand Prairie, Texas for Lockheed Martin's 
                            Enterprise Operations as an Applications Intern. As a part of the Data
                            Analytics Team, I aided in providing internal customers with applications
                            to improve business processes across multiple business functions, such as
                            production operations. Throughout the summer, I was given professional
                            advice on how to advance my career from leaders in the industry on topics
                            such as how to network and improve my chances of landing a leadership role.

                            Although I did not return to Lockheed the next summer, I found that my
                            experience developing software were extremely handy in many of my future
                            endeavors. My projects gave me a sense of what it was like to carry out
                            team software development using tools like git, and they showed me how to
                            connect with the customer or customers' needs to deliver the best application
                            possible. I am proud of the work I completed at Lockheed Martin because it
                            showed that I am capable of growing as a software developer if I put in the
                            effort to be constantly learning new tools. I learned the gratification
                            of receiving positive feedback and the iterative process that occurs when
                            I do not. The lessons I learned from my experiences will stay with me for
                            the rest of the career, as has already been evident: I already apply my
                            learning about team software to parts of both my personal and professional
                            life, as I have in my team projects in and out of class and have been in 
                            development of personal projects.

                            At the end of my internship, I presented my two projects to the VP of Enterprise
                            Applications. For the first part of
                            the summer, I learned Python well enough to program a web scraper using
                            the lxml and the requests library to gain competitive intelligence. From
                            this project, I learned the importance of data integrity, since I needed
                            to take the unstructured data of several html documents and convert them
                            to json files. I demonstrated to the Vice President that in order to preserve
                            the integrity of our data, we needed to either vigorously code to handle
                            many strange situations or continue updating our algorithm for extracting
                            data.

                            For my second project, I trained to use the SAP HANA database to help internal
                            Accounting and Production Operations employees more safely, quickly, and easily
                            access their data to make small daily changes. We crafted a JavaScript
                            application using SAP HANA XS (Extended Services) to carefully display requested 
                            data to the customers and allow them
                            to edit data one piece at a time. Because of this application, we were able to 
                            improve an otherwise costly
                            business process. Now that individuals who have access but not necessarily 
                            training to use tools such as SAP HANA can successfully navigate their data 
                            without the overhead of the Database Management System.

                            The main technical skills I took away were my knowledge of Python, SQL, 
                            JavaScript, basic network ideologies (which helped me in my then future
                            Networks class), some basic forecasting concepts in R, and Tableau. I 
                            also walked away with a better idea of how to work well in a company so
                            dependent on data and software, how to practice good software engineering
                            techniques, and above all, an overall bolstered self-confidence in my
                            technical problem-solving abilities.
