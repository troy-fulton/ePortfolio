            <p>I participated in Aggie Challenge, a research opportunity available to students at Texas
                A&M
                University as a class guided by graduate students and professors. I was a part of SpaceCRAFT, an
                interactive,
                web-based Virtual Reality Platform. SpaceCRAFT's purpose was to allow users from across the globe
                participate
                in projects collaboratively in order to test expensive, complicated projects in virtual reality
                simulations in
                order to make real-life decisions. Under the direction of astronaut and professor Dr. Greggory
                Chamitoff, we
                presented our findings to NASA at the end of the semester. I presented my research on how heightmaps
                from USGS's
                Astropedia can help SpaceCRAFT create fully functioning, to-scale models of our Solar System to NASA
                representatives.
                Our team also presented our simulations at the 2017 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase

            <p>As I gain more research experience in the future, I will put them here. I plan on gaining
                more research
                experience as a senior through my capstone project, which I plan to complete under the guidance of a
                professor as
                part of the <a href="https://launch.tamu.edu/Undergraduate-Research/Undergraduate-Research-Scholars-(thesis)">Undergraduate
                    Research Scholars Program.</a></p>
