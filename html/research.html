                                                For my undergraduate thesis, I worked on a project with my Computer Organization 
                                                professor, Dr. E.J. Kim, and the

                                                this experience was not my first in research, I am proud of what we have accomplished
                                                in this thesis. I cannot post the full thesis because of an embargo hold for a journal

                                                        In an age where big data is more available than ever, new high-bandwidth, low-latency
                                                        memory technology, such as Hybrid Memory Cubes (HMC), have extended into the third dimension
                                                        to tighten the increasing gap between memory and CPU speeds. Processing power built into
                                                        these new 3D memory technologies allows CPU cores to offload computations to memory, leading
                                                        to recent interest in the design space of Processing-In-Memory (PIM) when several HMC units
                                                        are chained together in a network. Using topology-oblivious Active-Routing techniques in such a
                                                        network, computations like dot products over a large set of data can be distributed across a virtual
                                                        "tree" such that partial results are compounded at every branch "on the way" back to the CPU.

                                                        We propose driving performance of Active-Routing by offloading computations to memory
                                                        with high throughput offloading techniques. We present Vault-Level Parallelism to further
                                                        parallelize computations by strategically dispatching computations to DRAM vault controllers
                                                        within each HMC. Our new implementation distributes the resources of Active-Routing to each
                                                        of the vault controllers in each HMC so as to reduce contention for compute resources. We simulate
                                                        our implemented techniques and assess their performance using previously developed microbenchmarks
                                                        and a widely accepted benchmark in scientific computing. The evaluation results show
                                                        an increase in overall data throughput throughout the Active-Routing Tree with an aggregate 23x
                                                        speedup.

                                                University as a class guided by graduate students and professors. I was a part of SpaceCRAFT, an interactive,
                                                web-based Virtual Reality Platform. SpaceCRAFT's purpose was to allow users from across the globe participate
                                                in projects collaboratively in order to test expensive, complicated projects in virtual reality simulations in
                                                order to make real-life decisions. Under the direction of astronaut and professor Dr. Greggory Chamitoff, we
                                                presented our findings to NASA at the end of the semester. I presented my research on how heightmaps from USGS's
