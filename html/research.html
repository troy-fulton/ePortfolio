                                <p>In Spring 2017, I participated in Aggie Challenge, a research opportunity available to students at Texas A&M
                                    University as a class guided by graduate students and professors. I was a part of SpaceCRAFT, an interactive,
                                    web-based Virtual Reality Platform. SpaceCRAFT's purpose was to allow users from across the globe participate
                                    in projects collaboratively in order to test expensive, complicated projects in virtual reality simulations in
                                    order to make real-life decisions. Under the direction of astronaut and professor Dr. Greggory Chamitoff, we
                                    presented our findings to NASA at the end of the semester. I presented my research on how heightmaps from USGS's
                                    Astropedia can help SpaceCRAFT create fully functioning, to-scale models of our Solar System to NASA 
                                    representatives. Our team also presented our simulations at the 2017 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase

                                    Starting Fall 2019, I will be investigating on-chip network routing with E.J. Kim and the

                                    to come on this new project as I learn more this summer about how on-chip networks work, but
                                    in Fall, I'll be performing research, and in the Spring of 2020, I'll publish my work to the 
                                    OakTrust catalog as the final step in the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program.
