                                    in Fall 2019, I'll be performing research, and in the Spring of 2020, I'll publish my work to the 
                                    OakTrust catalog as the final step in the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program.

                                        <u>Reflection Prompt #1: WHAT?</u> <br/>
                                        You are walking down a sidewalk, headed to a coffee shop to begin designing your 
                                        capstone project. You are juggling a laptop and a stack of papers with information 
                                        that you have gathered about your capstone. You look down at your phone to look at 
                                        the time. As soon as you look up, you accidentally bump into a stranger. You have 
                                        a death grip on your laptop, but your papers fly everywhere. The stranger bends 
                                        down to help you gather your papers and cannot help but notice the word “Capstone” 
                                        on more than one page. After retrieving a few papers that have flown away, the 
                                        stranger returns them to you and asks, “What is a capstone?”
                                    </p>

                                <p>In Spring 2017, I participated in Aggie Challenge, a research opportunity available to students at Texas A&M
                                    University as a class guided by graduate students and professors. I was a part of SpaceCRAFT, an interactive,
                                    web-based Virtual Reality Platform. SpaceCRAFT's purpose was to allow users from across the globe participate
                                    in projects collaboratively in order to test expensive, complicated projects in virtual reality simulations in
                                    order to make real-life decisions. Under the direction of astronaut and professor Dr. Greggory Chamitoff, we
                                    presented our findings to NASA at the end of the semester. I presented my research on how heightmaps from USGS's
                                    Astropedia can help SpaceCRAFT create fully functioning, to-scale models of our Solar System to NASA 
                                    representatives. Our team also presented our simulations at the 2017 Texas A&M Engineering Project Showcase
