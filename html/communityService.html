                            One of my favorite Aggie traditions is <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a>. 
                            Every spring, Aggies go out into the Bryan/College Station area to serve in their community and
                            engage with our fellow citizens to give back to our community for all they do for us. This event 
                            teaches me the importance of selfless service (one of Texas A&M's Core Values).

                            In April 2017, I participated with my friends from the Wind Symphony, and in March 2018, I decided 
                            I was passionate enough about it to want to lead our group, which taught me more about another 
                            Aggie Core Value (Leadership). As group leader, I served as the first point of contact with the 
                            resident we were assisting that day, and as a leader, I got to convince a few new people to join 
                            us this year.

                            I led the event again in March 2019, and I plan on leading one last group in 2020 if I can. 
                            Unfortunately, I didn't remember to take any pictures from 2019.

                            Another event I was a part of this year was Project Downtown. Through our Tau Beta Pi
                            chapter's partnership with the Brazons Valley Food Bank, I handed out food in two 
                            neighborhoods with financially struggling families in February 2019.
