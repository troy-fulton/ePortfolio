            <p><b>April-May 2015:</b></p>
            <p>I participated in a brass ensemble that travleled to homes of Alzheimer's patients as a
                part of
                an Eagle Scout Project for one of my friends.<p>
                    <p><b>April 2017:</b></p>
                    <p>I participated in Big Event), a large, campus-wide community service event
                        geared towards giving back to the Bryan-College Station Area. I learned a lot about Selfless
                        Service
                        (one of the core values of Texas A&M University) interacting with the family whose fence we
                        painted
                        and garden we helped clean and mulch.</p>

                    <p><b>March 2018:</b></p>
                    <p>Once again, I participated in Big Event, but this year, I volunteered to serve as
                        group leader for
                        my friends in the Wind Symphony. I got the word out to my friends to rally support before I
                        volunteered
                        for the chance to reach out to the family and perform organizational duties. This time, I
                        learned more
                        about another core value: Leadership. We all had a great time getting to know the family while
                        painting,
                        raking, and much more.</p>
