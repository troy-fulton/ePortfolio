                            Here are some of the personal projects I've decided to <i>start</i>. As ideas
                            pop into my head, I'll add them here. Some are finished, some are in the process, and some
                            are, well, just ideas. If you'd like to work together on a
                            project with me - whether it be on this list or not - let me know by 
                            <a href="mailto:troyfulton@tamu.edu">emailing me</a>
                            becuase I love to work collaboratively with others and get fresh perspectives on my
                            ideas.

                            Also note that <a href="https://github.com/troy-fulton">my personal GitHub</a> is where
                            I keep most of my personal projects organized.

                            <u>This Website:</u> This website has been in development since around Spring 2018, as I
                            tried to use it as a fun way to learn something about web development both for fun and
                            to prepare for my Lockheed Martin internship. Other than Bootstrap, I have written all the
                            JS/CSS/HTML you see before you. This website is under constant development.

                            <u>Bumblebee:</u> Spring 2019 TAMUHack project placed "runner-up" in the SmartCar Competition.
                            We used SmartCar's API to build an Android Application to find and unlock your car using Google Maps
                            API. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/LBess/Bumblebee">here</a>.

                            <u>Tile-sliding Game for Android:</u> Fall 2018 ACC Hackathon project.
                            As my first project using the Android Operating System, my friend and I developed a way to 
                            access the camera for a picture and use that picture to generate a puzzle.

                            <u>3D Printing:</u> As less of a project and more of a recreational hobby, I created the Avengers
                            logo in SOLIDWORKS and had a friend print it out so that I could put it on a keychain. The repo
                            where I keep all my designs can be found

                            <u>Resume Generator:</u> This project is still in the concept phase. This project is motivated
                            by the fact that I (as well as many other college students) constantly have the problem that 
                            we need a resume "on the fly" for something, and a "generic" resume won't cut it. I plan to write
                            something like a Java Applet that I could host on a website (maybe this one) so that
                            whenever I need to jam together a website, I can easily go to my website wherever I am,
                            find a printer, and have copies ready to go. Once I have it working for my purposes, I would
                            like to have it to where anyone can enter their information and get an instant resume.

                            <u>Music Generator:</u> As my interests in embedded technology develop, I'd like to apply 
                            what I've learned
                            about music composition over the 12 (and counting) years I have been playing to what I
                            have learned about electronics and algorithms. The purpose of this project is to explore
                            what motivates the creative processes that fuel music composition. Someday, I'd like to program 
                            a device to detect those stimuli and produce music for people. What factors could it take into
                            consideration? Consider:

                                    Biometrics such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature

                                    Ambient signals such as brightness or size of a room, noisiness, smell, 
                                    temperature
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Information surrounding a person such as the sentiments in the news, personal
                                    information from social media
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Musical preferences of a person
                                </li>
