    <p><b>April-May 2015:</b></p>
    <p class = "indent">I participated in a brass ensemble that travleled to homes of Alzheimer's patients as a part of
        an Eagle Scout Project for one of my friends.<p>
    <p><b>April 2017:</b></p>
    <p class = "indent">I participated in Big Event), a large, campus-wide community service event
        geared towards giving back to the Bryan-College Station Area. I learned a lot about Selfless Service
        (one of the core values of Texas A&M University) interacting with the family whose fence we painted
        and garden we helped clean and mulch.</p>

    <p><b>March 2018:</b></p>
    <p class = "indent">Once again, I participated in Big Event, but this year, I volunteered to serve as group leader for
        my friends in the Wind Symphony. I got the word out to my friends to rally support before I volunteered
        for the chance to reach out to the family and perform organizational duties. This time, I learned more
        about another core value: Leadership. We all had a great time getting to know the family while painting, 
        raking, and much more.</p>
